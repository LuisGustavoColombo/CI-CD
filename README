=========================================================================

This is the distribution of "less", a paginator similar to "more" or "pg".

The formatted manual page is in less.man.
The manual page nroff source is in less.nro.
Major changes made since the last posted version are in NEWS.

=======================================================================
INSTALLATION (Unix systems only):

1. Move the distributed source to its own directory and unpack it,
   if you have not already done so.  

2. Type "sh configure".
   This will generate a Makefile and a defines.h.
   Warning: if you have a GNU sed, make sure it is version 2.05 or later.

   The file INSTALL describes the usage of the configure program in
   general.  In addition, these options to configure are supported:

   --with-editor=program
     Specifies the default editor program used by the "v" command.
     The default is "vi".

   --with-regex=lib
     Specifies the regular expression library used by less for pattern
     matching.  The default is "auto", which means the configure program 
     finds a regular expression library automatically.  Other values are:
        gnu            Use the GNU regex library.
        pcre           Use the PCRE library.
        posix          Use the POSIX-compatible regcomp.
        regcmp         Use the regcmp library.
        re_comp        Use the re_comp library.
        regcomp        Use the V8-compatible regcomp.
        regcomp-local  Use Henry Spencer's V8-compatible regcomp
                       (source is supplied with less).
        none           No regular expressions, only simple string matching.
   --with-secure
     Builds a "secure" version of less, with some features disabled
     to prevent users from viewing other files, accessing shell
     commands, etc.


3. It is a good idea to look over the generated Makefile and defines.h
   and make sure they look ok.  If you know of any peculiarities of
   your system that configure might not have detected, you may fix the
   Makefile now.  Take particular notice of the list of "terminal" 
   libraries in the LIBS definition in the Makefile; these may need 
   to be edited.  The terminal libraries will be some subset of
       -lncurses  -lcurses  -ltermcap  -ltermlib

   If you wish, you may edit defines.h to remove some optional features.
   If you choose not to include some features in your version, you may
   wish to edit the manual page "less.nro" and the help page "less.hlp" 
   to remove the descriptions of the features which you are removing.
   If you edit less.hlp, you should run "make -f Makefile.aut help.c".

4. Type "make" and watch the fun.

5. If the make succeeds, it will generate the programs "less",
   "lesskey" and "lessecho" in your current directory.  Test the 
   generated programs.

6. When satisfied that it works, if you wish to install it
   in a public place, type "make install".

   The default install destinations are:
        Executables (less, lesskey, lessecho) in /usr/local/bin
        Documentation (less.nro, lesskey.nro) in /usr/local/man/man1
   If you want to install any of these files elsewhere, define
   bindir and/or mandir to the appropriate directories.

If you have any problems building or running "less", suggestions, 
complaints, etc., you may mail to bug-less@gnu.org.

Note to hackers: comments noting possible improvements are enclosed
in double curly brackets {{ like this }}.

(Note that the above note was originally written at a time when 
"hackers" most commonly meant "enthusiastic and dedicated computer 
programmers", not "persons who attempt to circumvent computer security".)
